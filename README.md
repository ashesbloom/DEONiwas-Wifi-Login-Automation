# DEONiwas-Wifi-Login-Automation
AutoLoginScript is an AutoHotkey script designed to automate the login process for the DEO Niwas hotspot. The script automatically opens the login page, enters the username and password, and submits the form, saving time and effort. It includes error handling for scenarios where the login window is not found or the clipboard fails to update.
