## Prerequisites

## Setup

1. Clone this repository or download the script file.
2. Open the `deo_niwas_login.ahk` file in a text editor.
3. Edit the script to add your username and password:
   ```autohotkey
   ; Your username goes here
   Send "your_username@deoniwas"
   
   ; Your password goes here
   A_Clipboard := "your_password"
   ```
4. Save the file after making these changes.

## Usage

2. Press `Win + W` to trigger the auto-login process.

## How It Works

1. The script opens the DEO NIWAS login page in your default web browser.
2. It waits for the login window to appear.
3. Once the window is active, it automatically fills in your username and password.
4. Finally, it submits the login form.

## Customization

To change the hotkey, modify the `!w::` at the beginning of the script. For example, `^!l::` would change it to `Ctrl + Alt + L`.

## Troubleshooting

- If the script fails to find the login window, it will display an error message.
- Make sure your internet connection is stable before running the script.
- Adjust the sleep timers if the script is running too fast or slow for your computer.
